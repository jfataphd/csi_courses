Internships require a daily log of activities, an assigned reading list or preparation of a relevant bibliography, and a final paper that summarizes the way in which goals were achieved and demonstrates the relationship of academic material to the work done during the internship. Internship courses are considered non-liberal arts and sciences. Internship students may not receive credit for paid employment unless they demonstrate the relationship of an appropriate body of academic material to the work required in their employment.
