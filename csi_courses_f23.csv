However, time series data is defined as which a statistical data collected its observations from a single object repeatedly over time. The classical probability theory that allows us to apply the conventional statistical analysis cannot be applied for this type of data because it is not i.i.d random sample by nature. Throughout this course, students will learn basic theories of Stochastic Process, a probability theory that applies for random variables defined on time, various time series analysis techniques based on stochastic process theories, and practice how to apply them for practical time series data in computer programming languages and software."
